        <h3>Ingredients :</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500 g Chicken Boneless</li>
            <li>100 g Gram Flour Besan</li>
            <li>1 Egg</li>
            <li>1 tsp Chilli Powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp Turmeric Powder Haldi</li>
            <li>1 tsp Coriander Seeds</li>
            <li>1 tsp Cumin Seeds Jeera</li>
            <li>100 ml Wate</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps :</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the chicken breast into long and thin strips.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl add the salt, chilli powder, egg, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, whole coriander seeds and the gram flour then mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Slowly add some water and mix until a paste-like consistency forms â€“ add the water gradually as you do not want the batter to end up too thick.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken strips into the mixture and make sure that each piece is coated evenly.</li>
            <li>Heat up the oil and make sure that the oil is hot enough to cook the chicken but not too hot that the batter will burn yet leave the inside uncooked.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken strips to the deep fryer and allow the chicken strips to cook for a few minutes before flipping over and allowing to cook further until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with a dipping sauce of your choice then enjoy!</li>
