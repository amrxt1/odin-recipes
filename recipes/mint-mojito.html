        <p>When life gives you mint leaves, what do you make? This mint mojito recipe!</p>
        <p>For the last few weeks, I’ve been making this classic rum cocktail nonstop. The combination of herbaceous mint, tart lime, and fizzy soda water is so refreshing. I love how pretty it is too. Garnished with mint leaves and a lime wedge, this mojito looks like a fancy drink you’d get at a restaurant or bar. But in fact, it’s easy to make at home! If you ask me, there’s no better way to cool off on a hot summer day.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients :</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh Mint</li>
            <li>White Rum</li>
            <li>Fresh Lime Juice</li>
            <li>Simple Syrup</li>
            <li>Club Soda</li>
            <li>Ice Cubes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps :</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>First, muddle the mint</strong>. Place it in the bottom of a cocktail shaker and use a cocktail muddler to press it until it becomes aromatic.</li>
            <li><strong>Second, shake!</strong> Add the rum, lime juice, simple syrup, and a handful of ice to the cocktail shaker, and shake it vigorously until the ingredients are completely combined and chilled.</li>
            <li><strong>Then, strain your mojito</strong>. Strain the contents of the cocktail shaker over a glass filled with ice. Top your glass with soda water, and garnish it with lime slices and more fresh mint sprigs.</li>
            <li><strong>Finally, taste and adjust</strong>. This step is essential anytime you’re making a cocktail at home. It gives you a chance to customize your drink to your tastes, finding a balance of flavors you really love. If you prefer a tarter mojito, add an extra squeeze of lime juice. If you want it sweeter, stir in a bit more simple syrup. Not strong enough? Well, you know what to do.</li>
